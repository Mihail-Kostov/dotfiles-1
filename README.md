# William's dotfiles

#### These are my dotfiles. There are many dotfiles like them; at least there are three others, because they're mostly cobbled together from the dotfiles of [Paul Irish](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles), [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/), and [alrra](https://github.com/alrra/dotfiles/). Thanks to them.
